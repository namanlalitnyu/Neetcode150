// #Question and Response
// You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.
// You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.
// Implement the KthLargest class:
// KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
// int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

class KthLargest {
public:
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > pq;
    int count;
    KthLargest(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());
        for(int i=0;i<min(k, (int) nums.size());i++) pq.push(nums[i]);
        count = k;
    }
    
    int add(int val) {
        if(pq.size() < count){
            pq.push(val);
        }else{
            pq.push(val);
            pq.pop();
        }
        return pq.top();
    }
};

// #Input
// ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
// [[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
// #Output
// [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
